# Technical debt and unresolved migration questions

No code has been inspected. The following are unknowns, not confirmed defects.

| Item | Status | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Complete script inventory and dependencies | Unknown | Inspect Studio Explorer and sources |
| Missing strict mode or legacy print/warn/wait/spawn | Not assessed | Record during verbatim capture; fix separately |
| Gameplay magic numbers | Not assessed | Review later for Constants.lua |
| Server authority and remote validation | Not assessed | Review one system at a time later |
| RBXScriptConnection cleanup | Not assessed | Review later |
| R15/SCAR legacy references | Not assessed | Record occurrences without assuming current direction |
| Script children, attributes, tags, RunContext, package behavior | Unknown | Capture before any sync mapping |
| Asset IDs, ownership/access, unpublished animation work | Unknown | Inventory and back up in Studio |

Do not create replacement systems to resolve speculative debt. Preserve baseline behavior during migration.
