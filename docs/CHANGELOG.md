## [2026-05-06] — Two type-safety fixes

- `src/server/RemoteSetup.server.lua`: fixed unsafe nil cast — `FindFirstChild` result is now left as `Instance?`, nil-checked first, then narrowed with `:: Folder` only inside the branch where nil is already ruled out
- `src/shared/Types.lua`: added a prominent sync warning on the `Phase` union explaining that Luau cannot derive it from `Constants.Phase` at compile time, and that both files must be updated together whenever a phase is added or renamed

---

## [2026-05-06] — Coding rules expanded in CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_RULES.md

- Added explicit "Config modules" rule: tunable values must live in `ReplicatedStorage/Modules`, never hardcoded
- Added "Explaining changes" rule: every task must list every changed file, explain how new code connects to existing systems, flag maintenance risks, and provide test steps
- These rules now appear in both `CLAUDE.md` (Claude behavior section + code rules) and `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md`

---

## [2026-05-06] — Stage 1 infrastructure + MatchService

- Added `default.project.json` (Rojo project), `wally.toml`, `selene.toml`, `stylua.toml`
- Added `src/shared/Constants.lua` — Phase enum (LOBBY, PREP, ACTIVE, RESULTS), all timing values, MAX_ROUNDS, MIN_PLAYERS
- Added `src/shared/Types.lua` — `Phase` and `RoundStatePayload` type exports
- Added `src/shared/WeaponData.lua` — stub, populated when GunService is built
- Added `src/shared/ZoneData.lua` — stub, populated when ZoneService is built
- Added `src/server/RemoteSetup.server.lua` — creates all RemoteEvents and RemoteFunctions in ReplicatedStorage/Remotes at server start
- Added `src/server/MatchService.server.lua` — full match loop: Lobby → (Prep → Active → Results) × 5, fires RoundStateChanged every second, handles GetMatchConfig for late-joining clients, exposes RoundEndedEarly BindableEvent for ObjectiveService
- Updated `docs/NAMING.md` — added PREP phase, corrected file extension table (`.server.lua`, `.client.lua`, `.lua`)
- Updated `docs/ROADMAP.md` — checked off Stage 1 items and MatchService
