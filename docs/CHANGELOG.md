## [2026-05-06] — DamageService + DEBT-006 resolution

- Added `src/server/DamageService.server.lua` — server-authoritative health tracking; `DamageService:Apply(victim, amount, attacker)` clamps damage and calls `killPlayer()` when health reaches zero; `HealthChanged` fires to the victim's client on every health change; health resets to `MAX_HEALTH` on every PREP phase for all connected players; `playerHealth` and `playerTeam` tables are cleared on `PlayerRemoving`
- Added `Constants.MAX_HEALTH = 100` to `src/shared/Constants.lua` — single source of truth for starting and maximum health (config module rule)
- Updated `src/server/MatchEvents.lua`: added `MatchEvents.TeamAssigned = Instance.new("BindableEvent")` — fired per-player inside TeamService's `assignTeams()`, consumed by DamageService for team tracking
- Updated `src/server/TeamService.server.lua`: added `MatchEvents.TeamAssigned:Fire(player, teamName)` inside the `assignTeams()` loop — resolves DEBT-006
- Updated `docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`: marked DEBT-006 resolved; added DEBT-009 (no friendly-fire guard in Apply() yet) and DEBT-010 (health reset during mid-respawn may cause brief Humanoid mismatch)

---

## [2026-05-06] — Resolve DEBT-008: GetMatchConfig errors now visible in Output

- Updated `src/client/MatchController.client.lua`: split the pcall `else` branch into two cases — `not ok` now calls `warn()` with the actual error string (red in Output) rather than a generic print; `ok` with a nil result keeps the original timing-fallback print
- Updated `docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`: marked DEBT-008 resolved with today's date

---

## [2026-05-06] — Technical debt tracking added

- Created `docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` — running registry of known maintenance risks and deferred problems; 8 entries covering: Phase type sync (DEBT-001), RemoteSetup Folder cast resolved (DEBT-002), lastFiredPhase phase-only comparison (DEBT-003), TeamService colours/offset not in Constants (DEBT-004), odd player split bias (DEBT-005), playerTeams has no observer signal (DEBT-006), MatchController applyState growth risk (DEBT-007), pcall silently swallows GetMatchConfig errors (DEBT-008)
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`: added `docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` to the required reading list; added two new Claude behavior rules — (1) add every flagged risk to TECHNICAL_DEBT.md before finishing a task, (2) read TECHNICAL_DEBT.md at the start of every task and report which entries are relevant before writing code

---

## [2026-05-06] — Fix PhaseChanged firing once per second instead of once per transition

- Updated `src/server/MatchService.server.lua`: added `lastFiredPhase = ""` to the State block; wrapped `MatchEvents.PhaseChanged:Fire()` in a `phase ~= lastFiredPhase` guard so it fires exactly once per phase transition rather than every second — all current and future listeners (TeamService, ObjectiveService) are automatically protected

---

## [2026-05-06] — Wire MatchService → MatchEvents

- Updated `src/server/MatchService.server.lua`: added `require(MatchEvents)` in the dependencies block; added `MatchEvents.PhaseChanged:Fire(phase, round)` inside `broadcast()` after `FireAllClients` — TeamService and future ObjectiveService now receive phase signals without polling

---

## [2026-05-06] — TeamService + MatchEvents bridge

- Added `src/server/MatchEvents.lua` — server-only ModuleScript holding `PhaseChanged` BindableEvent; bridges MatchService → TeamService (and future ObjectiveService) without polling; includes instructions for the two lines that must be added to MatchService to activate the connection
- Added `src/server/TeamService.server.lua` — assigns players to Roblox Teams on PREP, teleports each to a random spawn in `Workspace/Spawns/Attackers` or `Workspace/Spawns/Defenders`, fires `TeamAssigned` to each client, resets on RESULTS; handles missing spawn folders gracefully; exposes `TeamService:GetTeam(player)` for DamageService and ObjectiveService

---

## [2026-05-06] — MatchController (client)

- Added `src/client/MatchController.client.lua` — client-side match state mirror; syncs on join via `GetMatchConfig`, then stays current via `RoundStateChanged`; stores `currentPhase`, `currentRound`, `currentTimeLeft`, `currentMaxRounds` locally; prints state to Output for verification; exposes `GetPhase`, `GetRound`, `GetTimeLeft`, `GetMaxRounds` for MatchUI to call once built

---

## [2026-05-06] — Two type-safety fixes

- `src/server/RemoteSetup.server.lua`: fixed unsafe nil cast — `FindFirstChild` result is now left as `Instance?`, nil-checked first, then narrowed with `:: Folder` only inside the branch where nil is already ruled out
- `src/shared/Types.lua`: added a prominent sync warning on the `Phase` union explaining that Luau cannot derive it from `Constants.Phase` at compile time, and that both files must be updated together whenever a phase is added or renamed

---

## [2026-05-06] — Coding rules expanded in CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_RULES.md

- Added explicit "Config modules" rule: tunable values must live in `ReplicatedStorage/Modules`, never hardcoded
- Added "Explaining changes" rule: every task must list every changed file, explain how new code connects to existing systems, flag maintenance risks, and provide test steps
- These rules now appear in both `CLAUDE.md` (Claude behavior section + code rules) and `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md`

---

## [2026-05-06] — Stage 1 infrastructure + MatchService

- Added `default.project.json` (Rojo project), `wally.toml`, `selene.toml`, `stylua.toml`
- Added `src/shared/Constants.lua` — Phase enum (LOBBY, PREP, ACTIVE, RESULTS), all timing values, MAX_ROUNDS, MIN_PLAYERS
- Added `src/shared/Types.lua` — `Phase` and `RoundStatePayload` type exports
- Added `src/shared/WeaponData.lua` — stub, populated when GunService is built
- Added `src/shared/ZoneData.lua` — stub, populated when ZoneService is built
- Added `src/server/RemoteSetup.server.lua` — creates all RemoteEvents and RemoteFunctions in ReplicatedStorage/Remotes at server start
- Added `src/server/MatchService.server.lua` — full match loop: Lobby → (Prep → Active → Results) × 5, fires RoundStateChanged every second, handles GetMatchConfig for late-joining clients, exposes RoundEndedEarly BindableEvent for ObjectiveService
- Updated `docs/NAMING.md` — added PREP phase, corrected file extension table (`.server.lua`, `.client.lua`, `.lua`)
- Updated `docs/ROADMAP.md` — checked off Stage 1 items and MatchService

---
